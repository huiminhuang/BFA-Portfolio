  <div class="title"><p class="retrospect"><strong>Retrospect (Digital Video) by Mengshi, Huimin and Kyra</strong><h5 class="description">In this video, We worked off of our concept from our previous group project idea. This time we decided to call our video art “Retrospect.” This word describes our video of how our minds can wander simply from one memory, transformed into alternate realities within our dreams.<br>
       Mengshi and Huimin created graphics using Touch Designer and After Effects based on the color scheme of the first clip played in the video. Kyra remixed the audio to work cohesively with the various clips and glitch effects, as well as edit the final video and intro/outro clips. Music from Youtube Free Music Library.<br>
       During the video there is a recurring clip that displays the morphing of memories that one may encounter within their dreams. This clip creates unity within the video to support a constant “flow.” The “Tunnels” clips were to act as transitions within our memories during the transformation of “our memories.” In the end the final tunnel clip is the colorful roadway into our inevitable reality, that our alternate realities and dreams always come to an end.

  <div class="title"> <p class="wanderlust"> <strong>Wanderlust (Digital Video)  by Mengshi, Huimin and Kyra</strong>
  <h5><p class="description">Our installation video called ‘Wanderlust,” is based around the idea of driving with a sunset in view. Mengshi’s video is a recording of a sunset from the side view of the passenger window in a car. This single clip inspired our entire installation proposal. We wanted to create and provide an experience that allowed viewers to see an aesthetically pleasing array of colors in a normal view, kaleidoscope view, and glitch effect view on a “multichannel” setting. Given that this is a proposal, we placed all three clips on one single screen for the sake of time and easier access to playing the movie.<br>
          The colorful sunset provided unique opportunities to transform the clip into three different versions using TouchDesigner and Premiere Pro. We then placed the three clips horizontally on one single screen in Premiere Pro, which created a “multichannel” effect. If this proposal were to be turned into an installation, each video would be on its own personal mini screen television and played as a real multichannel video in a small room. The vast array of complementary colors from this single clip would provide an “ethereal” mood to the installation and invoke viewers to feel a sense of “Wanderlust.”</h5>
